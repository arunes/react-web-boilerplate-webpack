# React Web App Boilerplate with Webpack.js

To start a new bare project with [React.js][react] and [Webpack.js][webpack] follow the steps below.

## Installation

This project requires [Node.js][node] to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
# clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/arunes/react-web-boilerplate-webpack.git

# navigate to project folder (or change it as you wish)
cd react-web-boilerplate-webpack

# install node dependencies
npm install -d

# start the development server
npm start
```

For production environments...

```sh
npm build
```

And that's it, [Webpack.js][webpack] will take care of the rest.
